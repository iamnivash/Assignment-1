---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 1. Dynamic creation of different types of match data (live, historical, upcoming).

Solution:- Factory pattern:

The Factory Method pattern will be used to create different types of match information (e.g., LiveMatch, HistoricalMatch, UpcomingMatch). 
The system will have a MatchFactory interface, which will allow the creation of different match objects based on the type of match. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 2. Centralized access to match data for consistency and resource management.

Solution:- Singleton pattern:

In the Cric Info system, a DataManager class can be implemented as a Singleton. 
This class will handle the retrieval and storage of cricket match data, including live score updates, player information, and match statistics. 
we ensure that only one instance of the DataManager is used across the system, 
making it easier to manage shared resources and maintain consistency in the data being displayed to users.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 3. Efficiently handling multiple simultaneous user requests for live match updates.

Solution:- Multithreading:

By using multithreading, the Cric Info system can handle multiple requests for live updates concurrently. 
This is crucial for real-time data handling, where users might request live scores, player stats, or match updates simultaneously during a live match.
Multithreading ensures:- 
                       Processing of requests efficiently and without delay.
                       Providing instant updates to users even during peak traffic or major cricket events. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 4. Encapsulating complex cricket statistics and calculating metrics.

Solution:- Strategy Pattern

Use the Strategy pattern to define various algorithms for calculating player statistics, performance metrics, and other cricket-specific calculations.
